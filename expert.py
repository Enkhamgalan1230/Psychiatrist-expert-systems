def run_expert_system(kb):

    '''
    User Input and Initial Fact Matching
    Prompts the user to describe how they feel.
    Extracts symptoms from the input using extract_keywords.
    Marks matched symptoms as True in the facts dictionary.
    b) Identify Relevant Disorders
    Finds disorders explicitly referencing the matched symptoms using find_relevant_disorders.
    If no specific disorders match, switches to a broader check of all disorders.
    c) Ask Missing Questions
    Uses gather_missing_symptoms_for_disorders to query the user about required symptoms for relevant or all disorders.
    d) Evaluate Disorders with Threshold
    Evaluates disorders based on the match ratio using check_disorders_with_threshold.
    Disorders with a match ratio â‰¥ 60% are considered potential diagnoses.
    e) Finalize or Narrow Down Diagnoses
    If one disorder meets the threshold:
    Asks the user whether to finalize the diagnosis or query more symptoms.
    If multiple disorders remain:
    Offers the user an option to further narrow them down.
    If no disorders meet the threshold, informs the user that more data may be needed.

    Finalizes the diagnosis if only one disorder remains and the user chooses to confirm it.
    Otherwise, lists the potential disorders and their match details.
